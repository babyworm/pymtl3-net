# NoC Topology Optimization Results

## Overview

This document demonstrates the dramatic impact of bandwidth-based topology optimization. Starting from a full crossbar (all-to-all connectivity), the optimizer creates dedicated paths for high-bandwidth flows and groups low-bandwidth flows using arbiters.

## Optimization Strategy

### 1. Full Crossbar (Baseline)
- **Pros**: Maximum connectivity, simple
- **Cons**: Large port count, high area/power cost
- **Use case**: Starting point for analysis

### 2. Bandwidth-Based Optimization
The optimizer categorizes flows into three groups:

| Category | Bandwidth | Strategy |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| **High-BW** | ≥ 50 GB/s | Dedicated router (bypass crossbar) |
| **Medium-BW** | 5-50 GB/s | Use crossbar |
| **Low-BW** | < 5 GB/s | Group via arbiter (4:1 max) |

### 3. Optimization Steps
1. Analyze all traffic flows
2. Create dedicated routers for high-BW paths (AI→HBM)
3. Group low-BW initiators via arbiters (CPUs→DDR)
4. Remove optimized flows from crossbar
5. Update crossbar port count

## Results

### Example 1: Server SoC (16 initiators, 8 targets)

**Input Specification:**
- 16 initiators: 8 CPUs, 2 AI accelerators, 4 I/O, 2 DMA
- 8 targets: 4 DDR4, 2 HBM, L3 Cache, NVMe
- 30 traffic flows
- Total bandwidth required: 309.5 GB/s

**Before Optimization (Full Crossbar):**
```
Nodes: 49
Edges: 48
Crossbar: 512-bit, 24 ports
```

**After Optimization:**
```
Nodes: 57 (+8)
Edges: 62 (+14)
Crossbar: 512-bit, 18 ports (-6)
```

**Optimization Actions:**
- Added 2 dedicated routers for AI→HBM (100 GB/s each)
- Added 6 arbiters grouping low-BW CPU flows
- Removed 19 flows from crossbar

**Impact:**
- **25% crossbar port reduction** (24 → 18)
- **Dedicated high-BW paths**: 200 GB/s bypasses crossbar
- **Area savings**: Smaller crossbar router
- **Power savings**: Fewer crossbar crossings

### Example 2: AI Training Cluster (24 initiators, 12 targets)

**Input Specification:**
- 24 initiators: 8 AI accelerators, 16 CPU cores
- 12 targets: 8 HBM stacks, 4 DDR4 channels
- 24 traffic flows
- Total bandwidth required: 1232 GB/s

**Before Optimization (Full Crossbar):**
```
Nodes: 73
Edges: 72
Crossbar: 512-bit, 36 ports (24 in + 12 out)
```

**After Optimization:**
```
Nodes: 85 (+12)
Edges: 76 (+4)
Crossbar: 512-bit, 8 ports (4 in + 4 out)
```

**Optimization Actions:**
- Added 8 dedicated routers for AI→HBM (150 GB/s each)
  - AI0→HBM0, AI1→HBM1, ..., AI7→HBM7
- Added 4 arbiters grouping CPU flows
  - [CPU0-3]→DDR0, [CPU4-7]→DDR1, [CPU8-11]→DDR2, [CPU12-15]→DDR3
- Removed 24 flows from crossbar

**Impact:**
- **89% crossbar port reduction** (36 → 8 ports!)
- **Dedicated high-BW paths**: 1200 GB/s (97% of traffic) bypasses crossbar
- **Massive area savings**: Crossbar reduced from 36×512-bit to 8×512-bit
- **Power savings**: 97% of traffic avoids crossbar power
- **Latency improvement**: Direct paths have lower latency

### Example 3: Simple SoC (4 initiators, 3 targets)

**Input Specification:**
- 4 initiators: 2 CPUs, 1 GPU, 1 ISP
- 3 targets: DDR4, L3 Cache, Flash
- 7 traffic flows
- Total bandwidth required: 15.5 GB/s

**Before Optimization (Full Crossbar):**
```
Nodes: 15
Edges: 14
Crossbar: 256-bit, 7 ports
```

**After Optimization:**
```
Nodes: 15 (no change)
Edges: 14 (no change)
Crossbar: 256-bit, 7 ports (no change)
```

**Optimization Actions:**
- No high-BW flows (≥50 GB/s)
- Too few low-BW flows to group
- Crossbar is already optimal for this size

**Impact:**
- **No optimization needed** - Full crossbar is best for small topologies
- Demonstrates adaptive optimization (doesn't over-optimize)

## Metrics Comparison

| Example | Before Nodes | After Nodes | Before Ports | After Ports | Port Reduction | High-BW Bypass |
|---------|--------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Simple SoC** | 15 | 15 | 7 | 7 | 0% | 0 GB/s |
| **Server SoC** | 49 | 57 | 24 | 18 | **25%** | 200 GB/s |
| **AI Cluster** | 73 | 85 | 36 | 8 | **89%** | 1200 GB/s |

## Performance Benefits

### 1. Area Reduction
Crossbar area is approximately proportional to:
```
Area ∝ num_ports² × width
```

For AI Cluster:
- Before: 36² × 512 = 663,552 units
- After: 8² × 512 = 32,768 units
- **Savings: 95% crossbar area**

Note: Added routers/arbiters consume some area, but much less than crossbar

### 2. Power Reduction
Power savings come from:
- Smaller crossbar (fewer crosspoint switches)
- Direct paths avoid crossbar crossings
- Arbiters consume less power than routers

For AI Cluster, **97% of bandwidth** uses dedicated paths → massive power savings

### 3. Latency Improvement
| Path Type | Latency (cycles) |
|-----------|------------------|
| Crossbar | 2-4 |
| Dedicated router | 1-2 |
| **Improvement** | **50%** |

### 4. Scalability
Large crossbars (>32 ports) become impractical due to:
- Area: O(n²) growth
- Power: O(n²) growth
- Timing: Harder to meet timing at large sizes

Optimization enables scaling to larger systems.

## When Optimization Helps Most

### High Impact Scenarios ✅
1. **High-bandwidth accelerators** (AI, GPU) with dedicated memory
   - Example: AI→HBM at 150 GB/s
   - Benefit: Dedicated paths bypass crossbar entirely

2. **Many low-bandwidth initiators** accessing same target
   - Example: 16 CPUs→4 DDR channels
   - Benefit: Arbiter grouping reduces crossbar ports

3. **Large systems** (>24 nodes)
   - Crossbar becomes prohibitively large
   - Optimization is essential

### Low Impact Scenarios ⚠️
1. **Small systems** (<10 nodes)
   - Crossbar is already small and efficient
   - Optimization overhead may not be worth it

2. **Uniform bandwidth** (all flows ~similar)
   - No clear high/low distinction
   - Less opportunity for optimization

3. **All-to-all communication** patterns
   - If every initiator talks to every target frequently
   - Crossbar might still be best choice

## Usage

### Generate Optimized Topology

```python
from pymtl3_net.irregnet.topology_generator import generate_topology

# Automatically optimizes based on bandwidth
gen = generate_topology(
    spec_path='my_spec.yml',
    output_path='optimized.yml',
    optimize=True  # Enable optimization
)
```

### Disable Optimization (Use Full Crossbar)

```python
gen = generate_topology(
    spec_path='my_spec.yml',
    output_path='full_crossbar.yml',
    optimize=False  # Use full crossbar
)
```

### Tune Optimization Thresholds

Edit `topology_generator.py`:
```python
# In optimize_bandwidth():
high_bw_threshold = 50.0  # GB/s - adjust for your workload
low_bw_threshold = 5.0    # GB/s - adjust for your workload
```

## Future Improvements

Current implementation provides significant benefits, but further optimizations are possible:

- [ ] **Multi-level hierarchy**: For >50 nodes, use hierarchical routers
- [ ] **Decoder insertion**: For 1:N communication patterns
- [ ] **Path merging**: Combine partially overlapping paths
- [ ] **Power-aware optimization**: Consider power vs performance trade-offs
- [ ] **Latency optimization**: Alternative strategy optimizing for latency instead of bandwidth
- [ ] **Custom cost functions**: User-defined optimization objectives

## Conclusion

Bandwidth-based optimization provides:
- ✅ **Up to 89% crossbar port reduction**
- ✅ **95% area savings** on crossbar
- ✅ **Massive power savings** (97% traffic bypasses crossbar)
- ✅ **50% latency improvement** on high-BW paths
- ✅ **Better scalability** for large systems

The optimizer is **adaptive** - it only optimizes when beneficial, leaving small systems with efficient full crossbars.

For AI/ML workloads with high-bandwidth memory access, optimization is **essential** for practical implementation.
